## 🧭 Why I Build

I build AI systems not just to optimize performance, but to confront inequity, amplify underserved voices, and reimagine how technology serves humanity. My work lives at the intersection of public health, national security, and ethical innovation, translating technical depth into real-world urgency. From predictive models that inform life-saving decisions to crisis-response pipelines that prioritize transparency and trust, I design with purpose and with people in mind.
